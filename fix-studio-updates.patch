This patch fixes the live update issue in the Studio by adding version tracking to Layer objects.

The problem: React's shallow comparison doesn't detect when canvas pixels change because the
canvas object reference stays the same. Even though setLayers creates a new array, the canvas
object inside hasn't changed its reference.

The solution: Add a `version` field to layers that auto-increments whenever canvas is updated.

Changes needed:

1. src/ts/types/index.ts - Add version field to Layer interface (line 866):

   // Canvas data for this layer
   canvas: HTMLCanvasElement;

   // Version tracking for canvas content changes
   // Incremented whenever canvas pixels are modified to force React re-renders
   version: number;

2. src/contexts/StudioContext.tsx - Update updateLayer function (line 277):

   const updateLayer = useCallback((id: string, updates: Partial<Layer>) => {
     setLayers(prev =>
       prev.map(layer => {
         if (layer.id !== id) return layer;

         // Auto-increment version if canvas is being updated to force React re-renders
         // This ensures that even when the canvas reference stays the same but pixels change,
         // React will detect the update and trigger composition
         const newUpdates = updates.canvas
           ? { ...updates, version: (updates.version ?? (layer.version || 0) + 1) }
           : updates;

         return { ...layer, ...newUpdates };
       })
     );
     setIsDirty(true);
   }, []);

3. src/contexts/StudioContext.tsx - Initialize version in new layers:
   - Line 315 (duplicateLayer): version: 0
   - Line 361 (mergeLayerDown): version: (layer.version || 0) + 1
   - Line 395 (flattenAllLayers): version: 0
   - Line 579 (loadFromImage): version: 0

This fix ensures that every time canvas pixels are modified through updateLayer,
the version increments, causing React's dependency tracking to detect the change
and trigger the composition effect in StudioView.tsx.
